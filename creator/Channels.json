The gate of the spirit of self contains the energy of the love of humanity. This channel links the mundane, material plane, with the higher spiritual plane. It is sometimes referred to as the shaman channel, as initiation is often a shocking, potentially life-altering experience that is not sought but finds you, and transforms you to a higher realm of interacting with the world. \nAt its highest potential, this is energy contains the gift of awakening for yourself, and for others, through invitation, initiating an empowering change of behavior driven by willpower to survive the initiation and elevated to an understanding of universal love.

This alleviates the mental anxiety this channel creates. As part of the collective circuitry, this channel is equipped to answer questions that serve the collective, as opposed to those that involving your personal world. For you, concepts need to be backed by experimentation and proving, in order to be accepted. At the same time, you may hold on tightly to your answers as facts without them being substantiated.

You enjoy sharing your opinions about anything and everything, as the gate of opinions connects with the gate of details. What you have to share is best heard and accepted when it is invited / asked for. Internally, your mind is busy making mental cabinets of information, fitting what you observe into established patterns within your mind. There can be a level of rigidity with this energy as what doesn't fit into your perception or isn't integrated in your mind into your picture of the world, isn't fully understood.

In service of the collective, of which this channel is a part, when you are recognized to share what you intuitively see can be done better, what pattern can be perfected, you stand to help others who are ready to improve and correct. The challenge with this energy is two-fold - (1) waiting to be invited to share, as otherwise, it can be perceived as overly critical, especially if the gate of opinions, gate 17 is also active (2) keeping this insatiable desire for perfection outward and public-facing versus turning it inwards into a critical attitude towards yourself and your personal relationships. \nAt its highest potential, this energy's purpose ties in with that of Human Design overall - to reclaim the joy and love of life, by upgrading the collective's patterns and processes.
