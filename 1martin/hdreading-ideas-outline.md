### Conditioning

Human design **conditioning is the process by which we are influenced and shaped by the energy fields of those around us, including our family, friends, and society**. **This conditioning can lead us to act in ways that are not true to our authentic selves, causing us to feel uncomfortable and disconnected from our true nature.** However, by becoming aware of our conditioning and learning to see it for what it is, we can begin to strip away the layers of false identity and reclaim our true selves. The key to this process is awareness, which allows us to see the movie of our lives and make conscious choices that align with our authentic selves.

### Human Design as road map
Human Design is like a road map for your life, a manual that points out every little thing along the way. It is the blueprint of your multi-dimensional holographic quantum body, and it is here to nurture the individual and nurture uniqueness. Just like a car trip, we are passenger consciousness, here to experience at the highest levels possible of awareness what it is to be.

**Our minds are like rented vehicles, and we don't get them for long.** They are here to take in the experience and examine it, not to control it or define it. The deeper we move away from our minds running our lives, the more we get to see. We get to watch our minds and their distortions, and we don't have to be lost in them.

**Human Design teaches us to understand the importance of liberating ourselves from inherited beliefs and merged identities. It is about form principle, so that we can get to awareness.** **Without honoring our vehicle, without honoring this form, there is no way. We end up lost in a life where we cannot see, stuck in the homogenization, and we miss the joke and the fun that comes with that.**

The beauty of what it is to be us, the mystery of what it is to be us, is still just so wondrous. Human Design gives us the tools to recognize and claim our unique selves. It's time to stop diminishing ourselves and fighting who we are. It's time to reclaim our magnificent quantum selves and take our rightful place in the order of life.

In summary, Human Design is a road map for our lives, a manual that points out every little thing along the way. It teaches us to honor our vehicles and move away from our minds running our lives. It is here to nurture the individual and nurture uniqueness, and it gives us the tools to recognize and claim our unique selves. Just like a car trip, we are passenger consciousness, here to experience at the highest levels possible of awareness what it is to be.

query: explain authorities and decision making process
```
### Authorities and decisions
Authorities in Human Design refer to a person's unique decision-making process. There are four basic types of Authority: Emotional, Splenic, Sacral, and No Authority. Each type of Authority is based on a specific center in the BodyGraph. It is important to note that the mind is not used for decision-making in Human Design. Instead, a person must drop down into their body wisdom to access their truth. This can take time and practice, but it is worth it to live life on your own terms. Trusting your Authority and following your unique decision-making process can lead to a more aligned and fulfilling life.

```

### Empowered decisions
Authority is an internal process for making decisions that empowers individuals to connect with their innate knowing of what is true and correct for them. It is a way to steer towards a better, more reliable decision-making process that is specifically tailored to individual designs. This ability to take charge of one's life allows for trust in one's decisions, removing hesitancy and installing confidence.

However, many of us have been wrongly conditioned in how to reach decisions. **Society often makes decisions for us, without us even realizing it. The biggest conditioning factor is the belief that we should ‘think’ our way through life. For far too long, humanity has labored under this.**

Location and people around us heavily rely on this Authority. If a decision requires relocation, it would be wise to go visit the place first before committing, to make sure it feels correct. The best thing one can do to empower someone with this Authority is to let them talk. They gain clarity about a situation and how they feel about something by talking it out with others whom they trust.

This Authority is navigating invitations through the filter of “Does this make me feel more or less like my authentic self?” It is important to ask questions such as “**Does this decision make me feel more like me or less like me?**” “Is this the right direction for me?” “Will I feel good when I get to the destination that this decision will take me?” The more one learns to trust this inner guidance, the more reliable it will become as they learn from when it has led them to truth and when they let their mind lead them.

In conclusion, **Authority** is an internal process for making decisions that empowers individuals to connect with their innate knowing of what is true and correct for them. **It allows for trust in one's decisions, removing hesitancy and installing confidence.** It is important to let individuals talk and gain clarity about a situation and how they feel about something by talking it out with others whom they trust. Navigating invitations through the filter of “Does this make me feel more or less like my authentic self?” is crucial in making decisions that align with one's true nature.

### HD Parenting

Human Design is an incredibly useful tool for parents because it provides a unique and profound understanding of their children at the deepest level possible. This system is like a user manual for human beings, allowing parents to understand their own energy dynamics as well as their child's. By understanding their child's design, parents can support them to live their true nature and bring their unique gift to humanity.

**Human Design helps parents to accept their children for who they are, without trying to change them or correct their differences.** It gives parents the freedom to stop trying to be something they're not and finally embrace who they truly are. This system allows parents to set healthy boundaries when they realize there are things about people that they, or we, just cannot change.

When parents understand their child's design, they can support them to navigate what it means just to be themselves. **This system helps parents to recognize their child's unique qualities and help them grow into adults who enter healthier relationships, have healthier boundaries, and know their worth.** By using Human Design, parents can become a witness to their child's growth and who they are here to be without breaking their spirit.

In essence, Human Design is the instruction manual that parents long for when their children are born. It helps parents to understand the way they experience the world and what they need to be a better parent. By using this system, parents can create a stronger connection with their child and grow together. Human Design is a must-have for every parent (and parent-to-be) who wants to improve their connection with their child.

```

### Gates

Human Design gates represent specific energetic themes that give insight into personality, life purpose, relationships, creativity, intuition, and connection to Source. Each gate has a high and low expression, and there are six possible line activations for each gate, creating 384 possible gate activations within a chart. The position of the planets at the moment of birth determines which gates are defined in a chart. Defined gates are energies experienced consistently, while open gates are experienced in multiple ways depending on who you're with and where you are. The gates are located in the centers in the BodyGraph, and their themes correlate to the overarching theme of that energy center. Each gate corresponds to a hexagram in the I Ching, and each line adds a subtle nuance to a gate's meaning. When living out the highest expression of the energies in one's chart, the magic of life unfolds naturally.

### Strategy

Human Design Strategy is a way of being in the world without resistance. It aligns us with our unique geometry in the overall flow of the totality and supports the process of becoming our authentic self. Strategy is not a philosophy; it is based on the way our vehicle is genetically designed to operate on all levels. It accesses the unique ways energy is designed to flow through each person's BodyGraph and ultimately determines the way our health, sexuality, relationships, and life purpose play out.

All chart analysis begins at the level of Type. Each Type has a simple, understandable Strategy for efficiently and successfully interacting aurically with the other Types. The Human Design Mandala and BodyGraph provide the specific cosmic backdrop and blueprint, respectively, for determining this Strategy. Once you begin living your Type's Strategy, you will experience its rewards as your Type's signature: as peace (Manifestor), satisfaction (Generator), success (Projector), or as surprise (Reflector).

Following your Strategy offers you the opportunity to experience events and circumstances that are correct for you, while not following your Strategy can bring events and experiences into your life that may not be beneficial in the long run. Knowing your Type can help you develop confidence and trust in your capacity to make reliable decisions for yourself. Your Strategy gives you key information about how to make the right choices for you and how to recognize when you are on the right path.

Although decision making is tied directly to your Strategy, your Authority flavors the way you use your Strategy. Your defined centers will determine your Authority. Not all centers carry Authority, so your personal Authority will depend on your Type and your definition. Authority will also depend on your life conditioning and your level of emotional well-being. When you receive a Human Design analysis, you are taught to understand patterns of Authority and how to use them to make decisions that are correct for you.

In summary, Human Design Strategy is a way of being in the world without resistance. It aligns us with our unique geometry in the overall flow of the totality and supports the process of becoming our authentic self. Following your Strategy offers you the opportunity to experience events and circumstances that are correct for you, while not following your Strategy can bring events and experiences into your life that may not be beneficial in the long run. Knowing your Type and Authority can help you develop confidence and trust in your capacity to make reliable decisions for yourself.
