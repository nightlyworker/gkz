# Authority in Human Design

In the Human Design system, **Authority** refers to our unique decision-making strategy. It's a built-in mechanism that guides us to make decisions that are in alignment with our true nature. Understanding and following our Authority can lead to less resistance and more flow in life.

There are seven types of Authority in Human Design: Emotional, Sacral, Splenic, Ego Manifested, Ego Projected, Self-Projected, and None (Mental Projector). Let's explore each of these in detail.

## Emotional Authority

People with **Emotional Authority** are designed to make decisions after allowing their emotional wave to pass. This doesn't mean waiting until there are no emotions, but rather, waiting for emotional clarity. By observing their emotional wave – the highs, lows, and neutral points – they can reach a decision that feels right for them.

## Sacral Authority

**Sacral Authority** is about following your gut responses in the moment. This is common in Generators and Manifesting Generators. The Sacral Center communicates through visceral sensations or gut feelings, which can be interpreted as a "yes" (an attraction or pull towards something) or a "no" (a repulsion or lack of energy towards something).

## Splenic Authority

Those with **Splenic Authority** make decisions based on spontaneous intuition. The Spleen Center communicates through subtle, in-the-moment intuitive hits, often felt as a sense of safety or unease. This Authority requires trust in one's intuitive feelings and acting upon them in the moment.

## Ego Manifested Authority

Individuals with **Ego Manifested Authority** make decisions based on what they want and what is practical. The Ego Center, or Heart Center, communicates through willpower and desire. This is a rare Authority, found only in specific Manifestors.

## Ego Projected Authority

With **Ego Projected Authority**, decisions are made based on what will prove to be trustworthy and beneficial in the long run. It's about making promises and commitments carefully. This is a rare Authority, found only in specific Projectors.

## Self-Projected Authority

Those with **Self-Projected Authority** make decisions by verbally processing their thoughts and feelings. The G Center, or Self Center, communicates through identity and direction. This Authority, found in certain Projectors, is about listening to one's own voice and noticing how it feels to talk about different options.

## None (Mental Projector Authority)

**Mental Projectors** don't have an inner Authority; instead, they rely on their environment and other people to make decisions. They benefit from discussing options with others and observing how it feels to talk about them. Through this process, they can arrive at decisions that are correct for them.

## The Role of Authority in Decision-Making

Understanding your Authority can profoundly influence your decision-making process. Rather than being swayed by external influences or mental pressure, you can tune into your internal guidance system. This can lead to decisions that are more in alignment with your true self, resulting in a life of less resistance and more authenticity.

Remember, it's not about good or bad decisions, but rather about decisions that are correct for you. By following your Authority, you're honoring your unique design and making choices that support your journey in life.
