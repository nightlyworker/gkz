# Understanding and Supporting Your Child with a 6/2 Profile

As a parent, it is important to recognize and appreciate the unique qualities and challenges that come with your child's 6/2 Profile. This profile is characterized by a combination of wisdom, inner knowing, and a need for hermit time to access their gifts. By understanding and supporting your child's profile, you can help them navigate their journey and thrive in their own unique way.

## Recognizing Their Wisdom

First and foremost, it is crucial to acknowledge that your child with a 6/2 Profile is wiser than they may show. They have a long-view vision that allows them to see things others may not yet see. Listen to what they see and know with curiosity, as they may have valuable insights that you might not initially appreciate. Stretch beyond your limited perceptions and support them in listening to their own inner authority, even if their ideas seem out of the box.

## Embracing Their Unique Developmental Phases

The 6/2 Profile goes through three distinct phases in their developmental journey. Understanding these phases can help you better support your child's growth and self-discovery.

1. **First Phase (Birth to approximately 30 years):** During this phase, your child will dive into experiences and experiments, embracing trial and error. It is important to provide them with a safe and supportive environment where they can explore and try new things. Encourage them to learn from their experiences and ask them what they have learned from each situation. Avoid shaming them for any perceived mistakes, as they may already be insecure about their natural talents.

2. **Second Phase (Approximately 30 to 50 years):** In this phase, your child may feel frustrated that more things aren't happening for them. They may be late bloomers, and it is important to support them in being patient. Remind them that their time will come, and encourage them to stay true to themselves. Help them claim their Role Model self and embrace their unique gifts and talents.

3. **Third Phase (Post-50 years):** After a lifetime of objective observation, your child will have gained clarity about what works and what doesn't. They may be ready to re-engage in life and make a meaningful impact. Encourage them to share their wisdom and be a positive example for others.

## Nurturing Their Hidden Gifts

Take the time to notice and acknowledge your child's hidden gifts. These gifts may be obvious to you but not yet in your child's awareness. By naming and appreciating their talents, you can boost their self-confidence and help them embrace their unique abilities. Remember, they may be selective in their interests, but once they find something that truly resonates with them, they will excel and share their natural abilities.

## Building Trust and Intimacy

For a child with a 6/2 Profile, trust is essential for building intimate relationships. They cannot be intimate with anyone they cannot trust. As a parent, it is important to establish a foundation of trust with your child. Be reliable, consistent, and supportive. Avoid breaking their trust, as it can be difficult for them to regain that sense of security. Celebrate their successes and failures alike, as each experience is a learning opportunity for them.

## Embracing Their Transpersonal Destiny

The 6/2 Profile is one of the four Left Angle Crosses, and it has a transpersonal destiny. Your child's interactions with others are potentially transformational and life-altering. Encourage them to embrace these interactions and recognize the impact they can have on others. Help them understand that each encounter is an opportunity for growth and learning.

## Conclusion

Parenting a child with a 6/2 Profile requires understanding, patience, and support. By recognizing their wisdom, embracing their unique developmental phases, nurturing their hidden gifts, building trust and intimacy, and encouraging them to embrace their transpersonal destiny, you can help your child thrive and fulfill their potential. Remember, they are wiser than they may show, and by listening to their inner knowing, you can help them navigate their journey with confidence and authenticity.
