# The Four Types in Human Design

One of the foundational aspects of the Human Design system is the concept of **Types**. According to Human Design, every individual falls into one of four distinct Types: **Manifestors**, **Generators** (including **Manifesting Generators**), **Projectors**, and **Reflectors**. These Types provide a broad overview of our role in life and guide us in making decisions that align with our true selves.

## Manifestors

Manifestors represent about 9% of the population. They are the initiators, the ones who can start new things without needing to wait for external cues. Manifestors have a unique ability to impact others and make things happen. However, their impactful nature can sometimes be perceived as disruptive or overpowering. To maintain harmony in relationships, Manifestors are encouraged to inform others about their plans before taking action.

Manifestors have a defined throat center connected to a motor center, which gives them the energy to initiate and create change. Their strategy in life is to inform, and they can follow their urges without waiting for external validation or invitation.

## Generators

Generators are the life force of the planet, making up about 70% of the population (including Manifesting Generators). They have an inherent ability to generate and sustain energy, making them the doers and builders of society. Generators often find satisfaction in work and have the stamina to persist until a task is complete.

Generators have a defined sacral center, the powerhouse of life force and vitality. Their strategy is to wait to respond, meaning they should wait for something in their outer world to spark their internal response before they take action. This ensures they're using their energy in ways that truly satisfy them.

### Manifesting Generators

A subtype of Generators, Manifesting Generators share characteristics with both Manifestors and Generators. They have the ability to initiate like Manifestors but also have the staying power of Generators. Their strategy is a two-step process: wait to respond, then inform before taking action.

## Projectors

Projectors, making up about 20% of the population, are the guides and managers. They don't generate energy like Generators, but they have a unique ability to see and understand others. This makes them excellent at guiding and directing energy.

Projectors have an undefined sacral center, meaning they don't have consistent access to their own life force energy. Instead, they absorb and amplify the energy of others. Their strategy is to wait for an invitation before sharing their insights or taking on significant roles.

## Reflectors

Reflectors are the rarest Type, making up about 1% of the population. They are the mirrors of society, reflecting the health and wellbeing of their community. Reflectors have an extraordinary capacity for empathy and understanding.

Reflectors have all their centers undefined, making them highly sensitive to their environment. Their strategy is to wait a full lunar cycle before making major decisions, allowing them to gain perspective and clarity.

## Embracing Your Type

Understanding your Type is the first step towards living your design. By following your strategy, you can make decisions that are in alignment with who you are, leading to less resistance and more flow in your life.

Remember, no Type is better or worse than another. Each has its unique strengths and challenges. The key is to embrace our Type and use it as a guide for making decisions and navigating our roles in life.
