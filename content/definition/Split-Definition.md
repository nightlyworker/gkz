# Split Definition in Human Design
<!---
> explain and describe split definition
In the Human Design system, a single definition refers to a body-graph where all the defined (colored in) centers are connected to each other. This creates a continuous flow of energy within the person's design.
--> Human Design system paints a vivid picture of our unique energetic blueprint, offering illuminating insights into our strengths, challenges, and potential. Within this diverse palette, one of the most intriguing elements lies in the concept of "definition". Among the various types of definitions, the 'split definition' carries a unique blend of connection and independence, creating an intricate dance of energies.

## The Landscape of Split Definition

Imagine an archipelago - a group of islands separated by water but belonging to the same chain. This can serve as a fitting metaphor for a split definition in Human Design. In a split definition, the body-graph has two or more groups of defined (colored in) centers that are not connected to each other. They are like separate islands of consistent energy within the person's design.

## The Bridge of Connection

Just as islands in an archipelago are often connected by bridges or boats, split definition individuals often feel a need for others to bridge the gap between their defined areas. This is not a shortcoming but a fascinating aspect of their design that promotes connection and collaboration. The type of energy that can bridge the split depends on the specific centers and channels that are defined.

## The Dance of Energies

This unique design creates a dynamic energy dance. On the one hand, split definition individuals have an inherent understanding of synergy and collaboration. They can be great team players, fostering connection and cooperation wherever they go.

On the other hand, they may experience fluctuations in their energy and decision-making processes, depending on who they're with or the environment they're in. They may sometimes feel like different people, depending on which part of their split definition is being activated or bridged at any given time.

## The Challenge of Dependence

One of the challenges for split definition individuals lies in the potential for dependence. They may become overly reliant on certain people or conditions to feel whole or make decisions. It's like an island depending on a single bridge for all its resources and connections. There's a risk of becoming attached to people who bridge their split, even if the relationship isn't healthy or fulfilling in other ways.

## Charting Your Own Course

Understanding the dynamics of their split definition can empower these individuals to chart their own course in life. While others can bridge their splits, they also have the capacity to navigate their energies independently. By consciously choosing who and what they connect with, they can foster healthier relationships and environments that honor their unique design.

## Conclusion

Being a split definition individual in the Human Design system is akin to navigating a fascinating archipelago of energies. It's a journey of connection and independence, of consistency and variability. As they dance with their unique energies, split definition individuals can foster deeper self-awareness, and through understanding, they can more effectively interact with the world around them. Remember, every aspect of our Human Design is an invitation to understand ourselves better and appreciate the diverse energetic dance we all partake in.

## A person with a Split Definition
A person with a split definition in their Human Design body-graph has two or more groups of defined (colored in) centers that aren't connected to each other. This creates a "split" in the flow of energy within their design, which can influence their behavior in unique ways.

Here are some key aspects of their behavior:

1. **Seeking Connection**: People with a split definition often feel a need for others to bridge the gap between their defined areas. They naturally seek connections with others and can be particularly drawn to people whose energy "bridges the split" in their design. This makes them great at creating and maintaining relationships.

2. **Variable Behavior**: Their behavior can be variable and might change based on who they're with or the environment they're in. For instance, they may exhibit different behaviors or feel different when the split in their definition is bridged versus when it's not.

3. **Potential Dependence on Others**: Because people with a split definition often rely on others to bridge their energy split, they can become overly dependent on certain people or conditions to feel whole or to make decisions. They might feel incomplete or indecisive when they're alone or not in the right environment.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: On the positive side, the split in their definition can make them flexible and adaptable. They can often adjust to different people and environments because different conditions can activate different parts of their definition.

5. **Need for Understanding and Balance**: Because their energy and decision-making process can be influenced by others, it's important for them to understand their own design and to seek balance. They need to be mindful of who and what they allow to influence them, and to ensure that they're not giving too much power to external influences.

In summary, people with a split definition have a unique way of interacting with the world and others. They have a natural ability to connect with others, but they also need to manage the challenges that can come with their split definition. By understanding their design, they can navigate their relationships and environments more effectively, and can foster greater self-awareness and autonomy.
