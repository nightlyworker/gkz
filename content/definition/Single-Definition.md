# Single Definition in Human Design
<!---
> explain and describe single definition
In the Human Design system, a single definition refers to a body-graph where all the defined (colored in) centers are connected to each other. This creates a continuous flow of energy within the person's design.

## Characteristics of Single Definition

People with a single definition have a certain level of self-sufficiency and independence. They have a consistent and reliable way of processing information and making decisions because all their defined centers are communicating directly with each other. This doesn't mean they always behave predictably, but their core energy dynamics are stable and consistent.

Single definition individuals don't have a built-in need for others to bridge a gap in their energy (like those with a split definition do), so they often feel whole and complete on their own. They can make decisions independently and generally do not rely on others to feel complete or to make decisions.

## The Power and Challenges of Single Definition

The ability to process information and make decisions independently can be a great strength. It can allow for efficiency and quick decision-making, especially in situations that require on-the-spot decisions.

However, this independence can also come with its challenges. For instance, single definition individuals might have difficulty understanding why others (especially those with a split, triple, or quadruple definition) might need more time or input from others to make decisions. They might need to consciously practice empathy and understanding with those who operate differently.

Also, despite their independence, single definition individuals also need interaction with others. They could risk becoming isolated if they rely too heavily on their self-sufficiency and don't balance it with healthy relationships and interactions with others.

In conclusion, being a single definition individual in the Human Design system means having a level of self-sufficiency and independence, but it also means needing to understand and navigate the challenges that come with this type of definition. Like all aspects of Human Design, understanding one's definition can lead to greater self-awareness and more effective interaction with others.

## A person with a single definition

A person with a single definition in their Human Design has all their defined centers (colored in on the body-graph) connected to each other. This brings certain characteristics to their behavior:

1. **Self-Sufficient and Independent**: Single definition individuals often possess a strong sense of self-sufficiency and independence. They have an inherent wholeness about them and can make decisions and process information on their own.

2. **Consistent and Reliable**: Their energy flows smoothly within them, making their behavior and decision-making processes consistent and reliable. This doesn't mean they are predictable in every aspect of their life, but their core energy dynamics are stable and consistent.

3. **Less Need for Others in Decision-Making**: Unlike split definitions, single definitions do not have a built-in need for others to bridge a gap in their energy. They can make decisions independently and generally do not rely on others to feel complete or to make decisions.

4. **Potential for Not Understanding Others' Perspectives**: On the flip side, they might have difficulty understanding why others (especially those with a split, triple, or quadruple definition) might need more time or input from others to make decisions. They may need to consciously practice empathy and patience with others who operate differently.

5. **Fast-Paced Decision Making**: Depending on their type and strategy, they may be able to make decisions quickly and efficiently, since all their defined centers are in communication with each other.

6. **Potential for Isolation**: Despite their independence, single definition individuals also need interaction with others. There can be a risk of isolation if they rely too heavily on their self-sufficiency.

Remember, having a single definition doesn't make a person better or worse than someone with a different definition. It's simply one aspect of their unique Human Design. Understanding this can help them navigate relationships and situations more effectively.
