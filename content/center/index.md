# Centers in Human Design
Human Design comprises nine centers. Each of these centers has a specific significance and represents certain functions or aspects of a person's behavior. Here they are:

1. **Root Center**: Represents adrenal pressure and is associated with stress, impulse, and the drive to move forward.

2. **Sacral Center**: Represents life force energy and is associated with work, sexuality, and vitality. It's primarily linked with the ability to sustain activity over time.

3. **Solar Plexus Center**: Represents emotional energy and is associated with feelings, moods, and emotions.

4. **Spleen Center**: Represents survival instincts and intuition. It deals with health, well-being, and the instinctual recognition of what is safe or unsafe.

5. **G Center (also known as Identity Center)**: Represents identity, direction, and love. It's about sense of self, direction in life, and love.

6. **Heart Center (also known as Ego Center)**: Represents willpower and is associated with ego, material success, and the will to interact with society.

7. **Throat Center**: Represents communication and is associated with expression, action, and metamorphosis.

8. **Ajna Center**: Represents mental processing and is associated with conceptualizing, analyzing, and rationalizing.

9. **Head Center (also known as Crown Center)**: Represents inspiration and is associated with mental pressure to answer questions, inspiration, and the drive to make sense of the world.

In the Human Design System, these centers can be defined (colored in) or undefined (white). Defined centers represent consistent energy or traits in a person, while undefined centers are more flexible and adaptable, but can also be influenced by others.
