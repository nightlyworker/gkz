# Human Design Types
The foundational pillar of Human Design lies in its concept of Types, a Differentiation into five distinct ways of being: Manifestors, Generators, Manifesting Generators, Projectors, and Reflectors.

Each Type provides a specific roadmap that helps us interact with the world in the most fulfilling way possible. 
They reveal our inherent strengths and illuminate our challenges, giving us vital clues to how we function at our best. 
They shape our decision-making strategies, define our potential relationships with energy, and provide keys to our individual roles within the broader community.
