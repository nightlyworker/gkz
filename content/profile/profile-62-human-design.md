However, they must balance their desire for solitude with their role as a mentor, finding harmony between their social interactions and their need for introspection.

## Human Design 6/2 profile Role Model-Hermit
The Role Model-Hermit is a unique and powerful individual who possesses a natural authority and wisdom that sets them apart from others. From a young age, they may have been aware of this gift within themselves, or it may have gradually become apparent as they grew older. Regardless, their transpersonal power is evident even when they try to remain unnoticed.

One of the defining characteristics of the Role Model-Hermit is their ability to see the world from a bird's eye view. They have a knack for understanding the big picture and possess a wisdom that surpasses their years. This perspective allows them to navigate life with a sense of clarity and insight that others may struggle to attain.

The life of a Role Model-Hermit unfolds in a triphasic manner. The first third of their life is filled with numerous experiments and experiences, as they seek to understand what works and what doesn't. This trial and error process, combined with the hermit's natural inclination for solitude and introspection, can sometimes lead them to become withdrawn and pessimistic by the time they reach their thirties.

However, the next phase of their life is where the Role Model-Hermit truly thrives. They retreat from the world and take the time to assimilate and reflect upon the knowledge and wisdom they have gained from their experiences. It is during this period of solitude that their hermit side flourishes, and they are able to uncover their innate talents and gifts.

After the age of fifty, the Role Model-Hermit receives a calling to re-engage with life. They step back into the world with a renewed sense of purpose and become true role models for others. Their wisdom and authenticity inspire those around them, and they serve as a guiding light for humanity.

The Role Model-Hermit is often characterized by their high ideals, standards, and goals. They are idealists who are constantly seeking knowledge and new interests. Their insatiable curiosity drives them to become masters of general knowledge, and they possess an eternal optimism and enthusiasm for life.

However, there may be an unconscious tendency for the Role Model-Hermit to avoid committing fully to people or projects. They may exhibit a detached quality, as if they are holding back their abilities. But part of their role is to allow their innate talents to be called forth and utilized to their fullest potential.

Trust is of utmost importance to the Role Model-Hermit, as is their need for alone time and solitude. They may feel a strong pull to find their soulmate, and this theme may recur throughout their life. Ultimately, the Role Model-Hermit has the capacity to live their truth and act as a role model for humanity. They show others what it means to live as their full, authentic selves and inspire others to do the same.

In conclusion, the Role Model-Hermit is a wise and visionary individual who possesses a natural authority and transpersonal power. Their ability to see the big picture and their triphasic life journey make them wise beyond their years. With their high ideals, insatiable curiosity, and eternal optimism, they have the potential to become true role models for humanity. By embracing their innate talents and living authentically, they inspire others to do the same and show the world what it means to live a fulfilled life.
