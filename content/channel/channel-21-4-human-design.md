## Human Design 21-45 Channel of Money - A Design of a Materialist
The Channel of Money, also known as the 21-45 Channel, is a design in Human Design that represents a materialistic approach to life. This channel is part of the tribal ego circuit, which focuses on providing material resources for oneself and the tribe. It is an expressive channel that gives voice and expression to the energy of the circuit.

The Channel of Money encompasses the energy required to manage and control material resources. It also includes the willpower to declare and commit to work that creates wealth, in exchange for deserved rest. This channel is known to be the most driven manifesting channel, as it combines the desire for control and the need for influential leadership.

There is inherent tension between the two gates in this channel. Gate 21 represents the desire for control, similar to a prime minister who oversees the running of a country. On the other hand, Gate 45 represents influential leadership, akin to a king or queen who holds power and influence. Gate 45 is a step removed from the actual work itself, while Gate 21 focuses on managing and controlling resources.

Individuals with this channel defined may find that they work best when they are their own boss or have attained a level of independence that allows them to have control over their work and schedule. They thrive when they can follow their desires to generate wealth and assume empowered leadership roles for the benefit of themselves and the tribe.

At its highest expression, the Channel of Money represents the energy of following one's desires to generate wealth and assuming empowered leadership for the greater good. It encourages individuals to use their materialistic tendencies to benefit not only themselves but also their community or tribe.

Those with this channel defined may possess a natural talent for managing resources and creating wealth. They have the ability to make strategic decisions and take calculated risks to achieve financial success. However, it is important for individuals with this channel to be mindful of the potential tension between control and influential leadership. Balancing these two energies can lead to a harmonious expression of their materialistic nature.

In conclusion, the Channel of Money is an expressive channel within the tribal ego circuit. It represents the energy of managing and controlling material resources, as well as the willpower to create wealth. Individuals with this channel defined may work best when they have control over their work and schedule. They have the potential to use their materialistic tendencies for the greater good of themselves and their tribe.
