## In short
 The Human Design 6 Line Role Model is a fascinating concept that explores the different stages of growth and development in individuals. It suggests that we all go through three distinct phases in our lives, starting with a period of trial and error, followed by a time of retreat and introspection, and finally, a phase of becoming a role model for others. Understanding these stages can help us navigate our personal growth journey and inspire others along the way.

## Human Design 6 Line Role Model
The sixth line in Human Design is unique and distinct from all the other lines. It follows a triphasic pattern, going through three distinct phases in life. Understanding these phases can provide valuable insights into the nature and characteristics of individuals with a sixth line profile.

In the first phase, which spans from birth to around 30 years of age, individuals with a sixth line profile operate similarly to the three lines. They engage in experimenting and trial and error processes, seeking to understand themselves and the world around them. However, unlike the three lines, they may not possess the same level of resilience. As a result, they may become more pessimistic about life as they approach their 20s.

The second phase occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. During this period, sixth line individuals tend to retreat physically and/or emotionally from the world. This retreat is a means for them to regain their optimism and reflect on what has worked for them in the past. It is often referred to as "going up on the roof." This phase involves deep inner work, which can sometimes lead some sixth line individuals to mistakenly believe they are experiencing depression. However, it is an essential part of their personal growth and development.

The third and final phase begins at around 50 years of age. At this stage, sixth line individuals are nudged off the roof and encouraged to reengage with the world. They emerge as role models, bringing a unique perspective to the way life can work. This phase marks the culmination of their personal journey and the manifestation of their potential. It is during this stage that they truly bloom and make a significant impact on the world around them.

One of the defining characteristics of the sixth line is their deep sense of trust. They possess the ability to see the bigger picture, gaining a bird's eye view of life after their time on the roof. This perspective allows them to understand the interconnectedness of various aspects of life and make informed decisions. Additionally, sixth line individuals are driven to seek a soulmate. They may feel a sense of incompleteness until they find their perfect match, someone who aligns with their values and supports their growth.

From birth, the sixth line is born with an innate knowing. They have a natural inclination to seek truth, alignment, integrity, and perfection in life. This drive for authenticity and excellence shapes their actions and decisions throughout their journey. They are constantly seeking to align themselves with their true purpose and live a life that is in harmony with their inner values.

In conclusion, the sixth line in Human Design follows a triphasic pattern, going through three distinct phases in life. These phases involve experimenting and trial and error, retreating to reflect and regain optimism, and finally, emerging as role models with a unique perspective on life. Sixth line individuals possess deep trust, a bird's eye view of life, and a drive to seek a soulmate. They are born with an innate knowing and a desire for truth, alignment, integrity, and perfection. Understanding the characteristics of the sixth line can provide valuable insights into their personal growth and development as well as their potential impact on the world.
