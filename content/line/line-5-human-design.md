## Human Design 5 Line Heretic (Illuminator, Crazy Wisdom Guide)
The fifth line in Human Design is known as the Heretic, Illuminator, or Crazy Wisdom Guide. This profile line carries the most transpersonal karma and is considered the most universalizing of all the profile lines. Individuals with a fifth line profile have a unique ability to shine brightly like the sun, lighting up the world around them.

One of the key characteristics of the fifth line profile is their aura, which invites people in crisis to project onto them a potential for rescue. This means that individuals with this profile line often find themselves in situations where others see them as a savior or someone who can help them in times of need. However, it is important for those with a fifth line profile to be aware that what is really happening is an energetic mirroring for others to help them with healing and aligning their energy.

Due to the projections of others, fifth line profiles can also be masters of hiding. They may find themselves hiding behind a facade or a false persona, trying to live up to the expectations that others have projected onto them. It is important for individuals with a fifth line profile to recognize this tendency and to embrace their true selves, rather than trying to be what others want them to be.

In their highest expression, individuals with a fifth line profile have the capacity to influence a great number of people. Unlike individuals with a fourth line profile who tend to have a close-knit circle of friends and acquaintances, fifth line profiles have the ability to attract strangers and seduce the room with their personality, ideas, and even sexuality. They have a natural charm and magnetism that draws people towards them, making them great salespeople or influencers.

However, it is important for individuals with a fifth line profile to use their influence wisely and responsibly. They have the power to make a positive impact on others, but they must also be aware of the potential for manipulation or misuse of their influence. It is crucial for them to stay grounded and connected to their true purpose, which is to help others and guide them towards healing and alignment.

In conclusion, the fifth line Heretic, Illuminator, or Crazy Wisdom Guide in Human Design carries the most transpersonal karma and has the ability to shine brightly like the sun, lighting up the world. Their aura invites people in crisis to project onto them a potential for rescue, but it is important for them to recognize that they are simply mirroring the energy of others to help them heal. In their highest expression, individuals with a fifth line profile have the capacity to influence a great number of people and can seduce the room with their personality, ideas, and even sexuality. However, they must use their influence wisely and responsibly, staying true to their purpose of helping others and guiding them towards healing and alignment.
