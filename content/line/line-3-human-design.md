## Human Design 3 Line Martyr (Transformer, Experimenter)
The third line in Human Design is known as the Martyr or Experimenter. This energy represents individuals who learn through trial and error, embodying experiences to determine what works and what doesn't. They have a natural inclination to experiment and explore different paths in order to gain wisdom and understanding.

One of the key themes associated with the third line energy is the concept of bonds made and broken. These individuals tend to notice what doesn't work in relationships faster than others. They have a keen sense of discernment and are able to identify when something is not aligned or harmonious. This ability to recognize what doesn't work can sometimes lead to the breaking of bonds, as they are not afraid to let go of relationships that are not serving their highest good.

Despite their ability to notice what doesn't work, individuals with a third line energy are catalysts of change. They have a natural resilience and tenacity that allows them to navigate through challenges and obstacles. They may often feel alone in their journey, but they possess an inner strength that helps them persevere.

They understand that every experience, whether successful or not, is an opportunity for growth and learning. Their many experiments and experiences make them wise about life and enable them to share their insights with others.

It is interesting to note that half of the 12 profiles in Human Design carry a third line theme of mutation, trial and error, and discovery. Additionally, six lines live a third line process for the first 30 years of their lives. This suggests that the third line energy is a significant aspect of the human experience, shaping individuals' growth and development during their formative years.

Overall, the third line Martyr or Experimenter energy in Human Design represents individuals who learn through trial and error. They have a unique ability to recognize what doesn't work in relationships and possess a natural resilience and tenacity.
