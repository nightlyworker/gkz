## Human Design 4 Line Opportunist (Connector, Networker)
The fourth line in Human Design, known as the Opportunist or Connector, is the foundation of transpersonal relationships.

One characteristic of the fourth line is their reluctance to make changes easily or readily. Similar to the first line, there is a sense of insecurity associated with this profile. This insecurity may manifest as a fear of social rejection. As a result, individuals with a fourth line profile often prefer to have another job lined up before making a career shift or another potential relationship before leaving a current partner. The unknown can be extremely uncomfortable for them, and they prefer to have a sense of security in their transitions.

Despite their hesitancy towards change, fourth lines have a unique capacity to impact people on a personal level. They have a way with words and can touch people's lives through the power of their speech. Their ability to communicate effectively allows them to leave a lasting impression on others and create meaningful connections.
