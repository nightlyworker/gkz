# Gene Keys Cheatsheet

**Gene Keys** is a profound system that bridges ancient mystical teachings with modern genetic understanding. Through 64 archetypes, it provides a lexicon of consciousness designed to unlock human potential, showing how every challenge can be transformed into a gift and ultimately into an enlightened form.

## Understanding the Three Frequencies

1. **The Shadow**: This is the unconscious state. It represents our personal and collective fears, challenges, and latent patterns that are rooted in survival mechanisms.
2. **The Gift**: Each Shadow has a potential Gift, which is the transformed state of that shadow. It signifies the latent potential within the challenge.
3. **The Siddhi**: This is the highest divine potential, an enlightened trait. When a person fully transmutes a shadow and embodies the gift, they can further transcend to experience the Siddhi.
