## Human Design Gate 10 Treading - The Gate of the Behavior of the Self
Gate 10 Treading, also known as the Gate of the Behavior of the Self, is an energy that encourages individuals to be an example of deep self-love. It emphasizes the importance of knowing, accepting, and loving what makes each person unique, as this empowers others to love themselves as well.

However, in its low expression, Gate 10 Treading can manifest as a lack of self-love. When individuals are not fully accepting and loving themselves, it can become unbearable for them. In order to deflect these intolerable feelings, they may resort to blaming others and adopting a victim stance. This behavior not only hinders their own personal growth but also negatively impacts their relationships and interactions with others.

To address the low expression of Gate 10 Treading, it is important to check in with oneself and identify areas where self-acceptance and self-love are lacking. Engaging in shadow work, which involves exploring and integrating the unconscious aspects of oneself, can be beneficial in this process. Additionally, intentional and directed self-care practices can help individuals cultivate a deeper sense of self-love and acceptance.

In conclusion, Gate 10 Treading is an energy that encourages individuals to be an example of deep self-love. By knowing, accepting, and loving what makes them unique, they empower others to do the same. Taking personal responsibility and acting in an empowered way are key aspects of embodying this gate. However, when individuals are not self-loving, they may resort to blaming others and adopting a victim stance.
