# Human Design Gate 19 Approach - The Gate of Wanting
## In short
 Gate 19 Approach, also known as the Gate of Wanting, explores our desires and how we approach them. It teaches us to balance our wants with practicality and patience, helping us manifest our desires in a more fulfilling way.

## Human Design Gate 19 Approach - The Gate of Wanting
The Gate 19 Approach, also known as the Gate of Wanting, represents the energy of emotional sensitivity. As a person with this gate activated in your Human Design chart, you have the potential to be highly attuned to the needs of others as well as your own. This sensitivity can be both a gift and a challenge, depending on how you navigate it.

On the positive side, you prioritize your own self-care and well-being. You understand that in order to be of service to others, you must first take care of yourself. When the people around you are emotionally healthy and have their needs met, you thrive. This is because you are able to create a harmonious and supportive environment where everyone's emotional needs are acknowledged and fulfilled.

However, there may be times when you struggle with neediness, oversensitivity, or putting your own needs last. This can be particularly challenging if you find yourself constantly seeking validation and approval from others. It is important to recognize that while it is natural to want to be loved and appreciated, relying solely on external sources for validation can be draining and unsustainable.

To navigate these challenges, it is crucial for you to consciously set and communicate your boundaries. This means being clear about what you are comfortable with and what you are not. By doing so, you can protect your own emotional well-being and prevent yourself from becoming overwhelmed by the needs of others.

Taking ownership over filling your own cup first is another important aspect of managing the energy of the Gate 19 Approach. This means prioritizing self-care activities that nourish and replenish you. Whether it is engaging in hobbies, spending time in nature, or practicing mindfulness, finding activities that bring you joy and fulfillment is essential. By taking care of yourself first, you are better equipped to support others in a healthy and sustainable way.

It is also important to remember that you are not responsible for meeting the needs of others at the expense of your own well-being. While it is admirable to be sensitive and empathetic towards others, it is equally important to recognize that everyone is responsible for their own emotional health and well-being. By encouraging others to take ownership of their own needs and supporting them in doing so, you create a balanced and mutually supportive dynamic.

In conclusion, the Gate 19 Approach represents the energy of emotional sensitivity. As someone with this gate activated, you have the potential to be highly attuned to the needs of others as well as your own. By consciously setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and encouraging others to take ownership of their own needs, you can navigate the challenges and harness the positive aspects of this energy. Remember, taking care of yourself is not selfish, but rather a necessary foundation for supporting others in a healthy and sustainable way.
