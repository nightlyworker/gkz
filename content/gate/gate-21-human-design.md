## Human Design Gate 21 Biting Through - The Gate of the Hunter / Huntress
Gate 21, also known as Biting Through, is one of the 64 gates in the Human Design system. It is referred to as the Gate of the Hunter/Huntress and carries a unique energy that revolves around understanding and respecting the value of resources, such as time, money, and energy, both for oneself and the community. This gate teaches us the importance of managing these resources with integrity.

At its highest potential, the energy of Gate 21 is about management and control in a way that empowers everyone involved. It encourages us to take responsibility for our resources and use them wisely, not only for our own benefit but also for the greater good. When we are able to harness this energy positively, we can create a harmonious balance between our personal needs and the needs of the community.

However, at its lowest expression, Gate 21 can manifest as a need for control over others. This can lead to manipulative behaviors, people-pleasing tendencies, or even shutting down our own power. When we try to control others, we often disregard their autonomy and limit their potential for growth. This can create a negative cycle of anger, bitterness, and resentment within ourselves and in our relationships.

To overcome the negative aspects of Gate 21, it is important to practice deepening our trust in others and in the flow of life. By releasing the need to control, we can open ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences. Trusting in the abilities and decisions of others allows us to foster healthier relationships and create a more supportive community.

Additionally, the energy of Gate 21 can be powerfully channeled into activities and habits that benefit from control. When we direct this energy towards areas of our lives that require structure and discipline, we can achieve great success. By focusing on self-control and managing our resources effectively, we can accomplish our goals and create a sense of stability and security.

In conclusion, Gate 21 Biting Through is a powerful energy that teaches us the importance of understanding and respecting the value of resources. It encourages us to manage our time, money, and energy with integrity, both for our own benefit and for the benefit of our community. By practicing trust and releasing the need to control, we can harness this energy positively and create a harmonious balance in our lives.
