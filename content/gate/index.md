# Gates in Human Design
Gates in Human Design represent specific energetic themes that provide insight into various aspects of our lives. They reveal our personality, life purpose, relationships, creativity, intuition, and connection to Source. Each gate has a high and low expression, and when we embody the highest expression of our gates, we experience the magic of life unfolding naturally. Through affirmations and exercises, we can discover how these energies influence our lives and strive to live in alignment with our unique gates.
