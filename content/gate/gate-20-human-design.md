# Human Design Gate 20 Contemplation - The Gate of the Now
## In short
 Gate 20 Contemplation, also known as the Gate of the Now, encourages us to embrace the present moment and find peace within ourselves. By letting go of past regrets and future worries, we can fully experience the beauty and potential of the present. This gate teaches us the importance of mindfulness and living in the now, leading to a more fulfilling and authentic life.

## Human Design Gate 20 Contemplation - The Gate of the Now
Gate 20, also known as the Gate of Contemplation or the Gate of the Now, is a powerful energy that is here to inspire others and connect people and resources. It operates in the right time and with the right recognition, without aggression or force. When this gate is defined in a channel, it gives voice to various aspects of our being.

One aspect that is expressed through Gate 20 is the spleen's intuitive survival awareness. The spleen is our body's instinctual intelligence, and when it is connected to Gate 20, it brings a heightened sense of awareness and intuition about what is necessary for our survival and well-being. This intuitive awareness can guide us in making the right choices and taking the right actions in the present moment.

Another aspect that Gate 20 can manifest is the G center's commitment to higher principles. The G center is the center of identity and direction, and when it is connected to Gate 20, it brings a sense of purpose and a commitment to living in alignment with our higher principles and values. This can inspire others and create a sense of unity and connection.

Gate 20 can also manifest the sacral's power through action. The sacral center is the center of life force energy and vitality, and when it is connected to Gate 20, it brings a powerful energy that can be channeled into taking action and making things happen. This energy can be contagious and inspire others to take action as well.

In its highest potential, Gate 20 is an expression of integrity. It is about doing the right thing despite what others are doing or what society expects of us. It is about being true to ourselves and our values, even when it may be challenging or unpopular. This integrity can inspire others and create a ripple effect of positive change.

Gate 20 is also the energy of being present and speaking the truth in the now. It is about being fully present in the current moment, without regrets or resentments about the past or expectations and hopes for the future. It is about embracing the present moment as it is and speaking our truth from a place of authenticity and vulnerability.

However, there can be challenges associated with Gate 20 as well. One challenge is the tendency to make choices from the mind instead of our inner wisdom. This can lead to regrets and a sense of being disconnected from our true selves. Another challenge is an inability to be fully present in the current moment. This can manifest as stress or anxiety about the past or future, preventing us from fully experiencing and enjoying the present moment.

To raise the energy of Gate 20, it is important to practice mindfulness and trust that when we need to know something, we will know. It is about letting go of the need to control or force things to happen and instead surrendering to the flow of life. It is about being open and receptive to the guidance and wisdom that is available to us in each moment.

In conclusion, Gate 20 is a powerful energy that is here to inspire and connect. It can manifest in various ways, such as through the spleen's intuitive survival awareness, the G center's commitment to higher principles, or the sacral's power through action. In its highest potential, it is an expression of integrity and being present in the now. However, there can be challenges associated with Gate 20, such as making choices from the mind instead of inner wisdom or an inability to be fully present. By practicing mindfulness and trusting in the flow of life, we can raise the energy of Gate 20 and live in alignment with our true selves.
