It is about becoming a diamond, a precious gem that reflects the light of the divine in every facet of our being.

The Diamond of the Self is a metaphor for the process of spiritual transformation. Just as a diamond is formed under intense pressure and heat, so too our true self is forged in the crucible of life's challenges and experiences. It is through the process of facing and overcoming these challenges that we are able to polish and refine our character, revealing the diamond within.

## Gift - Style

It is the way we present ourselves to the world, the way we communicate, the way we interact with others, and the way we live our lives. Style is not about conforming to societal norms or expectations, but about being true to ourselves and expressing our individuality.

Style is an outward manifestation of our inner essence. It is a reflection of our values, beliefs, and personality. When we embrace our style, we are embracing our true self. We are acknowledging and celebrating our uniqueness. We are expressing our individuality and creativity. And in doing so, we are inspiring others to do the same.

Mediocrity is a form of self-betrayal. It is a denial of our true nature and potential. It is a refusal to shine, to express our brilliance, and to live a life of purpose and passion. When we succumb to mediocrity, we are denying ourselves the opportunity to become the diamond that we are meant to be.

## Sidhi - Exquisiteness

Exquisiteness is a reflection of our divine nature. It is the manifestation of our true self in all its brilliance and beauty. When we embody exquisiteness, we are expressing our divine essence. We are radiating love, light, and beauty. We are inspiring others with our presence and our actions. And in doing so, we are contributing to the upliftment of humanity.
