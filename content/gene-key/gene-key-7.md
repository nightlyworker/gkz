# Gene Key 7: Virtue is its Own Reward

## Description

Gene Key 7, also known as "Virtue is its Own Reward," is a profound and transformative concept within the Gene Keys system. It represents the journey from the shadow frequency of Division to the gift of Guidance and ultimately to the Siddhi of Virtue. This Gene Key teaches us that the highest reward in life is not material wealth or external recognition, but the inner peace and fulfillment that comes from living a virtuous life.

## Gift - Guidance

The gift of Gene Key 7 is Guidance. This is not the kind of guidance that comes from outside, but the inner guidance that arises when we align ourselves with our highest values and principles. When we live in accordance with our inner guidance, we become a beacon of light for others, inspiring them to also live their truth.

Guidance is about being in tune with your inner compass, your intuition, and your higher self. It's about making decisions that are in alignment with your highest good and the highest good of all. When you operate from this place of guidance, you become a leader in the truest sense of the word - not because you seek to control others, but because you inspire them to find their own inner guidance.

## Shadow - Division

The shadow frequency of Gene Key 7 is Division. This represents the state of consciousness where we see ourselves as separate from others and from the world around us. Division leads to conflict, competition, and a sense of isolation. It is the root cause of many of the problems we face in our personal lives and in the world at large.

Division arises from fear - fear of the unknown, fear of difference, fear of loss. When we are in the shadow frequency of Division, we see the world through the lens of scarcity and competition. We believe that there is not enough to go around, and so we must fight to get our share.

## Siddhi - Virtue

The Siddhi of Gene Key 7 is Virtue. This is the highest potential of this Gene Key, the state of consciousness where we realize that virtue is its own reward. Virtue is not about following a set of rules or conforming to societal expectations. It is about living in alignment with our highest values and principles, regardless of external circumstances or pressures.

When we embody the Siddhi of Virtue, we become a living example of integrity, compassion, and wisdom. We inspire others not through our words, but through our actions. We become a beacon of light in a world often shrouded in darkness.
