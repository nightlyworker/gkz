		<h2>Your Bodygraph</h2>
		<!--
	<p>
					The bodygraph, also known as the Human Design chart, is calculated using two sets of data: the Personality calculation and the Design calculation. The Personality calculation is based on the moment of birth, while the Design calculation is based on a time approximately 88 days (or precisely 88 degrees of the sun) prior to the actual birth. These calculations take into account the date, place, and exact time of birth. The resulting chart consists of a triangle called the body graph, which visually represents the individual's unique energy configuration. The body graph includes nine centers, each responsible for carrying and managing a specific frequency of energy related to different themes in our lives. The chart also includes numbers and planetary symbols that indicate the positions of the planets and the hexagrams they occupy at the time of birth. The black numbers in the chart represent the conscious aspect, while the red numbers represent the unconscious aspect. By combining the conscious and unconscious neutrino streams, which have picked up the energies of the planets, the bodygraph provides valuable information about an individual's best strategy to navigate life, how they function, learn, and use their energy wisely, their purpose, what drives them, and their spiritual path. It is important to note that each person's chart is unique and perfect in its own way, and all the puzzle pieces are needed for a complete understanding.

					The bodygraph, or Human Design chart, is calculated using two sets of data: the natal or Personality calculation and the pre-natal or Design calculation. The natal calculation is based on the moment of birth, while the pre-natal calculation is based on a time approximately 88 days prior to birth. These calculations take into account the energies of the planets and the hexagrams they occupy at the time of birth. The bodygraph is a visual representation of this unique energy configuration, providing valuable information about a person's strategy, function, learning style, purpose, energy management, drives, and spiritual path. It also reveals strengths and vulnerabilities. Each piece of the chart offers a different perspective, creating a deep understanding of oneself. The bodygraph is a perfect reflection of an individual's operating system, and through Human Design, we can unlock the wealth of information it holds to support personal growth and transformation.
